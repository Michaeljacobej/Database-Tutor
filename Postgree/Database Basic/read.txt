What Is A Database?
A database is a collection of information – information that’s preferably related, and preferably organised. This means that a database can be in any form or shape. 
It could be a pile of paper records in an office, or a large Excel sheet, or on a computer (most likely in this day and age). But in the most basic terms,
 a database just helps you store data – so ultimately you can decide what it is.

How to Update a Database
You can make changes to the different parts of a database using various commands. There are two general types of commands:

Data Definition Language (DDL)
First, we have Data Definition Language, or DDL. It’s made up of commands that define or alter the shape or structure of the data in the database. 
These commands affect the metadata part of a database.

Data Manipulation Language (DML)
We also have Data Manipulation Language, or DML. It’s made up of commands that interact with the data stored in the database. 
These commands do not affect the structure of the data, but rather the data itself. These command only affect the data part of a database.

What Is a Database Model?
A database model is a concept used to describe the information stored on a database. Think of it as a building’s blueprint designed by an architect. 
It details all the tables, columns, and datatypes of the database. But it, in itself, is not a physical entity like the database. A database model determines how data is logically represented and accessed.

Database models define if data is stored in tables using rows and columns, or in JSON-like objects. They also define how data relates, how you can query it, and how you manage it.
Database models are often chosen (and often developed) to suit specific data/application needs.
