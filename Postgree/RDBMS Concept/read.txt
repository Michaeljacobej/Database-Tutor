Database Management System

Database Management System or DBMS in short refers to the technology of Storign and Retrieving users data with utmost efficiency along with appropriate security measeures

Why to learn DBMS? 
tar data was organized in file formats. 
DBMS was a new concept then and all the research was done to
make it overcome the deficiencies in traditional style of data management

a Modern DBMS has the following chatacteristic
Real world entity - A modern DBMS is more realistic and uses real world entities to design its architecture

Relational based tables
DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables

Isolation of data and application
-A database system is entirely different than its data

Less redundancy
DBMS follows the rules of normalization

Consistensy
Consistency is a state where every relation in database remains consistency

Query Languages
DBMS is equiepped with query language which make it more efficient to retrieve and manipulate data

DBMS Characteristic
Database is a collection of related data and data is a collection of facts and figures that can be processed to produce information

a database management system store data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve , manipulate and produce information

ACID Properties
DBMS follows the concept of Atomicity , Coonsistency , Isolation and Durability (onormaly shortened as ACID) These concepts are applied on transactons which manipulate data in a database

Multiuser and concurrent Access
DBMS support multi user environment and allow them to access and manipulate data

Multiple views 
DBMS offers multiple views for different users

Security
Features like multiple views offer security to some extent where users are unable to access data of other users and department

Users
a typical DBMS has users with different rights and permissions who use it for different purposes

Administrators
Administrators maintain the DBMS and are responsible for administrating the database

Designers
Designers are the group of people who actuallyu work on the designing part of the database

End Users
ende users are those who actually reap the benefits of having a DBMS


-------------------Architecture-----------------------------------

3 tier Architecture

Presentation Tier
Application Tier
Database Tier

Database Tier - at this tier , the database resides along with its query processing languages

Application middle Tier - at this tier reside the application server and the programs that access the database

User(Presentation Tier) - 
End users operate on this tier and they know nothing about any existence of the database beyond this layer

-----------------Data Model------------------------

Entity Relatinship Model
Entitiy Relationship model is based on the notion of real world entities and relationship among them

Entitites and their attributes
relationship among entitites

Entity 
an entity in an ER Model is a real world entity having properties called attributes

Relationship
the logical association among enitties is called relationship. relationship are mapped with entities in various ways


one to one
one to many
many to one
many to many 	

relational model
the most popular data model in dbms is the relational model it is more scientific a model than others. this model is based on first order predicate logic and define a table as an n-ary relation

data is stored in tables called relations
relations can be normalized
in normalized relations , values saved are atomic values
each row in a relation contains a unique value
each column in a relation contains values from a same domain

Database Schema
a database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database

--------------------Entity Relaitonship Model------------------------
the ER Model defines the conceptual view of a database. it works around real world entititees and the associations among them

Entity
an entitiy can be a real world either animate or inaminate, that can be easily identifiable 
for example

in a school database , students ,teachers ,classes and courses offered can be considered as entities. all these entities have some attributes or properties that give them their identify

Attributes
Entities are represented by meands of their properties called attributes. all attributes have values for examole a student entity may have some values and ages as attributes

Type of Attributes

Simple attribute 
simple attributes are atomic values which cannot be divided further for example a students phone number is an atomic value of 10 digit

Composite attribute
Composite attribute are made of more than one simple attribute for example a students complete name may have first_name and last_name

Derived attribute
Derived attributes are the attributes that do not exist in the physical database, but their values are derived from other attributes present in the database

Single value attribute
single value attribute contain single value for example - Single_Security_Number

Multi-value attribute
multi value attributes may contain more tha one values for example a person can have more than one phone number, email address , etc

------------------------------------------------------------RDBMS Benefits and Limitations---------------------------------------------------
Here are some of the benefits of using an RDBMS:

Structured Data: 
RDBMS allows data storage in a structured way, using rows and columns in tables. 
This makes it easy to manipulate the data using SQL (Structured Query Language), ensuring efficient and flexible usage.

ACID Properties: 
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 
These properties ensure reliable and safe data manipulation in a RDBMS, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.

Normalization: 
RDBMS supports data normalization, a process that organizes data in a way that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity.

Scalability: 
RDBMSs generally provide good scalability options, allowing for the addition of more storage or computational resources as the data and workload grow.

Data Integrity: 
RDBMS provides mechanisms like constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys to enforce data integrity and consistency, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable.

Security: 
RDBMSs offer various security features such as user authentication, access control, and data encryption to protect sensitive data.

Here are some of the limitations of using an RDBMS:

Complexity: Setting up and managing an RDBMS can be complex, especially for large applications. 
It requires technical knowledge and skills to manage, tune, and optimize the database.

Cost: RDBMSs can be expensive, both in terms of licensing fees and the computational and storage resources they require.

Fixed Schema: RDBMS follows a rigid schema for data organization, which means any changes to the schema can be time-consuming and complicated.

Handling of Unstructured Data: RDBMSs are not suitable for handling unstructured data like multimedia files, social media posts, and sensor data, as their relational structure is optimized for structured data.

Horizontal Scalability: RDBMSs are not as easily horizontally scalable as NoSQL databases. Scaling horizontally, which involves adding more machines to the system, can be challenging in terms of cost and complexity.
